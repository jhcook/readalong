## ADR‑001: Use Hybrid Local + Cloud Architecture
Status: Accepted
Date: 2025‑12‑27

Context
The system must support:

Parent voice capture

Real‑time highlighting

Offline capability

High‑quality cloned voice playback

Privacy for children and parents

Local processing is essential for privacy and responsiveness.
Cloud processing is essential for high‑quality TTS.

Decision
We will use a hybrid architecture:

Local: STT, forced alignment, highlighting, caching

Cloud: ElevenLabs TTS (optional), cloud sync (optional)

Consequences
Positive

Strong privacy guarantees

Offline functionality

High‑quality narration via cloud

Reduced latency for STT

Negative

More complex architecture

Requires fallback logic for offline mode
