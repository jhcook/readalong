## ADR‑005: Use WebExtensions API for Desktop Browsers
Status: Accepted

Context
We must support Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.
We want a single codebase for browser extensions.

Decision
Use the WebExtensions API with:

Manifest V3 for Chrome/Edge

Compatibility layer for Firefox

Xcode wrapper for Safari

Consequences
Positive

One codebase for all browsers

Modern security model

Predictable permissions

Negative

Safari requires additional packaging

Firefox still uses Manifest V2
