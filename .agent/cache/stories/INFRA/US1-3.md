# US1.3: Highlight Words in Sync

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
The core value of "reading along" is visual reinforcement. The system needs to highlight the exact word being spoken at the right time to help the child follow along.

## User Story
As a child I want words to highlight as they are spoken So that I can follow along easily.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Highlighting updates at least 30fps.
- [ ] **AC2**: Only one word is highlighted at a time.
- [ ] **AC3**: Highlight color meets accessibility contrast standards.
- [ ] **AC4**: Highlighting pauses when audio pauses.
- [ ] **AC5**: Highlighting resumes correctly after pause.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance (UI updates @ 30fps minimum)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-001: Use Hybrid Local + Cloud Architecture
- ADR-006: Use React for Web UI and React Native for Mobile

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: Text Renderer (UI Component), Audio Player
Workflows affected: Playback
Risks identified: Audio/Visual desync due to main thread blocking or network lag (if streaming).
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Visual regression testing / manual review.
- Performance profiling to ensure 30fps.
- Unit tests for the state machine handling "playing", "paused", "stopped" states.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Revert UI component changes.
