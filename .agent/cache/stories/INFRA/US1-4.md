## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
Standard fonts and colors are not suitable for all readers, especially those with dyslexia or visual impairments. The tool must adapt to their needs to be effective.

## User Story
As a parent I want to enable dyslexia‑friendly and high‑contrast modes So that my child can read comfortably.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: User can toggle dyslexia font.
- [ ] **AC2**: User can toggle high‑contrast mode.
- [ ] **AC3**: Settings persist locally.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-010: Use a Child-Safe UI Mode
- ADR-007: Use IndexedDB and Secure Mobile Storage (for settings persistence)

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: UI Components, Theme Provider, Settings Store
Workflows affected: Reading, Settings
Risks identified: New fonts might break layout; high contrast might clash with some UI elements.
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Visual inspection of Dyslexia font rendering.
- Automated accessibility audit (e.g., Lighthouse, axe-core) for contrast ratios.
- Verify settings persistence across page reloads/app restarts.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Revert theme/font changes.
- Reset user settings if necessary.
