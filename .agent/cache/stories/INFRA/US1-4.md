## State
COMMITTED

## Problem Statement
Standard fonts and colors are not suitable for all readers, especially those with dyslexia or visual impairments. The tool must adapt to their needs to be effective.

## User Story
As a parent I want to enable dyslexia‑friendly and high‑contrast modes So that my child can read comfortably.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: User can toggle dyslexia font.
- [x] **AC2**: User can toggle high‑contrast mode.
- [x] **AC3**: Settings persist locally.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance)
### Security
- [x] No PII in logs
- [x] No secrets in code
- [x] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [x] No PII in logs
- [x] No secrets in code
- [x] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [x] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [x] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-010: Use a Child-Safe UI Mode
- ADR-007: Use IndexedDB and Secure Mobile Storage (for settings persistence)

## Impact Analysis Summary

- Verify settings persistence across page reloads/app restarts.

**QA Governance**:
- [x] Are there new tests for new features?
- [x] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Revert theme/font changes.
