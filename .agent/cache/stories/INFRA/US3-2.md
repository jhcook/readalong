# US3.2: Handle Paraphrasing

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
Parents reading naturally often substitute words or skip phrases. If the system demands 100% text match, the highlighting will break. The system needs "fuzzy" matching logic.

## User Story
As a parent I want the system to tolerate natural speech variations So that I don’t have to read perfectly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Minor paraphrasing does not break alignment.
- [ ] **AC2**: System skips unmatched words with fallback logic.
- [ ] **AC3**: Highlighting continues smoothly.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- User Experience (Seamless recovery from mismatch)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-003: Use Forced Alignment for Word‑Level Highlighting

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: Alignment Engine, Playback Logic
Workflows affected: Reading
Risks identified: Too loose matching might highlight wrong words; too strict breaks flow.
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Unit tests with Levenshtein distance thresholds or similar fuzzy logic.
- User testing with parents reading naturally.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Revert fuzzy matching logic adjustments.
