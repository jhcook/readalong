## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC1**: User can play back the recorded audio immediately after stopping recording.
- [x] **AC2**: Playback controls (play/pause) are available.

- [x] **AC4**: Previous recording is cleared/replaced when a new one starts.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- User Experience (Intuitive controls)
### Security
- [x] No PII in logs
- [x] No secrets in code
- [x] Compliance docs checked if applicable
