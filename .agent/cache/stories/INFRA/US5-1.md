# US5.1: Play/Pause Narration

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
Children need basic control over the playback flow, especially to pause if they are interrupted or need a break. The controls must be extremely simple and robust.

## User Story
As a child I want to pause and resume So that I can follow at my own pace.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Play/pause button is large and touch‑friendly.
- [ ] **AC2**: Highlighting pauses/resumes with audio.
- [ ] **AC3**: State persists if the app is backgrounded.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Usability (Fitts's Law compliance for button size)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-010: Use a Child‑Safe UI Mode

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: Player UI, Audio Engine
Workflows affected: Playback
Risks identified: Audio state getting out of sync with UI state (e.g., UI shows playing, audio is stopped).
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Manual testing on touch devices.
- Lifecycle testing (backgrounding app while playing).
- Unit tests for player state machine.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Revert UI/State logic.
