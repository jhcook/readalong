# US5.2: Back One Sentence

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
Children often lose focus or want to reinforce a concept. Navigating by scrubber bar is too difficult for fine control. They need a simple "Jump Back" button that aligns with sentence structures.

## User Story
As a child I want to go back one sentence So that I can re‑read something I missed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Back button jumps to previous sentence.
- [ ] **AC2**: Highlighting updates immediately.
- [ ] **AC3**: Audio restarts from the beginning of that sentence.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsiveness (Seek time < 100ms)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-009: Use a Unified Alignment Map Format (Defines sentence boundaries)
- ADR-010: Use a Child‑Safe UI Mode

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: Player Controller, Alignment Engine
Workflows affected: Navigation
Risks identified: Jumping to a sentence with no audio mapping (if alignment failed).
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Unit tests for navigation logic (array index manipulation).
- Test boundary conditions (First sentence, Last sentence).
- Verify audio seek accuracy.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Revert navigation logic.
