# US5.3: Forward One Sentence

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
Children may want to skip boring parts or move ahead if they've already read a section. A simple "Next Sentence" button provides this control without complex scrubbing.

## User Story
As a child I want to skip ahead So that I can move faster.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Forward button jumps to next sentence.
- [ ] **AC2**: Highlighting updates immediately.
- [ ] **AC3**: Audio restarts from the beginning of that sentence.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsiveness (Seek time < 100ms)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-009: Use a Unified Alignment Map Format
- ADR-010: Use a Child‑Safe UI Mode

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: Player Controller, Alignment Engine
Workflows affected: Navigation
Risks identified: Rapid clicking causing race conditions in audio engine.
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Stress test rapid forward clicking.
- Verify end-of-text behavior (Should stop or loop?).
- Unit tests for index logic.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Revert navigation logic.
