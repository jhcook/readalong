# US5.3: Select Page HTML Element

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
An HTML page may have several elements with content not of interest to the user. The user needs the ability to select the content they wish to be spoken.

## User Story
When a child clicks the plugin’s toolbar button, the plugin enters element‑selection mode. In this mode, the plugin overlays a highlight around the HTML element currently under the mouse cursor, following the DOM structure (e.g., div, section, article, span). When the child clicks an element, the plugin captures and stores the corresponding HTML block and exits selection mode.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: The plugin enters element‑selection mode when the child clicks the plugin’s toolbar button.
- [ ] **AC2**: The plugin overlays a highlight around the HTML element currently under the mouse cursor, following the DOM structure (e.g., div, section, article, span).
- [ ] **AC3**: The plugin captures and stores the corresponding HTML block and exits selection mode when the child clicks an element.
