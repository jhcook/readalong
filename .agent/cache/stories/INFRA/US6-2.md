# US6.2: Inject Reading UI Into Webpage

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
The tool needs to live "on top" of the existing web content without breaking it. Shadow DOM encapsulation is critical to prevent style bleeding.

## User Story
As a child I want a simple reading interface So that I can focus on the story.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: UI overlays cleanly on any webpage.
- [ ] **AC2**: UI can be minimized or closed.
- [ ] **AC3**: UI does not break page layout.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Isolation (Zero CSS conflicts with host page)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-005: Use WebExtensions API for Desktop Browsers
- ADR-006: Use React for Web UI and React Native for Mobile

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: Content Script, Shadow DOM container
Workflows affected: Reading
Risks identified: z-index wars with site elements; sites blocking iframe/script injection (CSP).
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Test on complex sites (NYTimes, YouTube, Single Page Apps).
- Verify Shadow DOM encapsulation.
- Test resize/minimize behavior.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Update extension to disable injection.
