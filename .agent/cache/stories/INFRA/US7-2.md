# US7.2: Read in Mobile WebView

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
To reuse the complex highlighting logic from the desktop extension, we should leverage a WebView or shared logic where possible, while ensuring performance remains "native-like".

## User Story
As a child I want to read inside the app So that I don’t need a browser.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Text loads in a WebView or native renderer.
- [ ] **AC2**: Highlighting works identically to desktop.
- [ ] **AC3**: Child controls are touch‑optimized.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance (Smooth scrolling, 60fps animations)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-006: Use React for Web UI and React Native for Mobile

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: WebView Bridge, Text Renderer
Workflows affected: Reading
Risks identified: WebView to Native bridge latency causing audio sync issues.
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Compare desktop vs mobile highlighting behavior.
- Test touch interactions (scrolling vs tapping words).
- Verify offline behavior within WebView.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Revert app version.
