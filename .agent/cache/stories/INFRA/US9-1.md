## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
Privacy is the primary selling point. We must enforce and validate that "Local Only" truly means local only.

## User Story
As a parent I want my voice to stay on the device So that my privacy is protected.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: No raw audio is sent to cloud.
- [ ] **AC2**: Local STT is used by default.
- [ ] **AC3**: UI clearly indicates local processing.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Compliance (COPPA / GDPR)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-008: Use a Local‑Only Privacy Model by Default

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: Network Interceptors, STT Config
Workflows affected: Recording
Risks identified: Accidental telemetry logging of audio metadata or snippets.
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Static Code Analysis to verify no audio buffer transmission.
- Pen-testing / Packet sniffing during recording sessions.

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
