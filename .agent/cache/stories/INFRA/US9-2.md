# US9.2: Child‑Safe Mode

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
The app must be safe for unsupervised use. Kids shouldn't be able to delete data, change settings, or navigate to random websites via the WebView.

## User Story
As a parent I want a restricted mode So that my child cannot access unsafe content.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Child mode hides advanced settings.
- [ ] **AC2**: Child mode locks with a PIN.
- [ ] **AC3**: Child mode restricts external links.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Security (PIN not stored in plain text)
### Security
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Compliance
- [ ] No PII in logs
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Compliance docs checked if applicable
### Observability
- [ ] Is OpenTelemetry added for new flows?
- [ ] Are logs structured and governed?

## Linked ADRs
- ADR-010: Use a Child‑Safe UI Mode

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: Navigation Controller, Settings UI
Workflows affected: App Navigation
Risks identified: Forgot PIN scenarios (need recovery flow).
**Architect Governance**:
- [ ] Do ADRs exist for major changes?
- [ ] Are architectural boundaries respected?
**Product Governance**:
- [ ] Are Acceptance Criteria clear and testable?
- [ ] Is the Impact Analysis complete?

## Test Strategy
How will we verify correctness?
- Attempt to bypass "Child Mode" UI checks.
- Verify PIN persistence and lockout logic.
- Click testing on external links (should be blocked).

**QA Governance**:
- [ ] Are there new tests for new features?
- [ ] Is the Test Strategy section in the Story comprehensive?

## Rollback Plan
How do we revert safely?
- Reset "Child Mode" flag in local storage.
