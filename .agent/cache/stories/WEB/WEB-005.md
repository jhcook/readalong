# WEB-005: Auto-scroll Highlighted Text

## State
DRAFT

## Problem Statement
Currently, the highlighted text in the Reading Pane does not scroll automatically. Users have to manually scroll to keep up with the reading, which breaks immersion.

## User Story
As a user I would like the highlighted text to automatically scroll as it gets to the bottom. when the scrolling text is on the last line of the window, the next line needs to scroll to the top of the window as soon as the last word is read.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The Reading Pane automatically scrolls when the highlighted word is on the last visible line of the container.
- [ ] When scrolling triggers, the next line of text is repositioned to the top of the viewport.
- [ ] Scrolling happens smoothly and allows seamless reading.
- [ ] Works with all voice sources (System, ElevenLabs, Recorded).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Scrolling must be smooth (60fps).
- Observability: No specific requirements.

## Linked ADRs
- None

## Impact Analysis Summary
Components touched: ReadingPane.tsx
Workflows affected: Reading/Playback
Risks identified: Scrolling might interrupt user interaction.

## Test Strategy
- Manual verification using the extension playback.
- Unit tests mocking `HTMLElement.offsetTop` etc.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert changes to ReadingPane.tsx.
