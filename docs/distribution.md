# Distributing ReadAlong Extensions

This guide outlines the steps to publish the ReadAlong browser extension to official browser stores.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before submitting to any store, ensure:
- You have built the production assets: `npm run build` in `web/extension`.
- You have generated the distribution packages: `npm run package` in `web/extension`.
- You have the `release/` directory containing `readalong-chrome.zip`, `readalong-firefox.zip`, and `readalong-safari.zip`.
- All automated tests pass: `npm test`.

## 2. Chrome Web Store (Chrome / Edge / Brave)

1.  **Developer Account**: Create a developer account at the [Chrome Web Store Developer Console](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole). (One-time fee required).
2.  **Add New Item**: Click "New Item".
3.  **Upload**: Upload `readalong-chrome.zip`.
4.  **Metadata**:
    - **Description**: Provide a clear, child-safe description.
    - **Screenshots**: Upload at least one 1280x800 or 640x400 screenshot.
    - **Icon**: Upload a 128x128 icon.
5.  **Privacy**: Describe why the extension needs the requested permissions (e.g., `activeTab` for text extraction).
6.  **Review**: Submit for review.

## 3. Firefox Add-ons (AMO)

1.  **Account**: Sign in to [AMO Developer Hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/).
2.  **Submit**: Click "Submit a New Add-on".
3.  **Upload**: Upload `readalong-firefox.zip`.
4.  **Self-Distribution vs. AMO**: Choose "On this site" for hosting on AMO.
5.  **Version Notes**: Use this template:

```
Firefox compatibility fixes:
- Added data_collection_permissions (required: ["none"]) - extension does not collect any data
- Implemented fallback audio playback for browsers without offscreen API
- Removed sandbox.js (vosk-browser STT) as it exceeded 5MB file limit

Regarding validation warnings:
- "Function constructor is eval": From @opentelemetry tracing library (safe, no user input)
- "Unsafe innerHTML": All HTML is sanitized via DOMPurify before assignment. Used for:
  • Rendering sanitized article content in reading pane
  • Creating temporary DOM elements for text extraction (immediately discarded)
```

6.  **Notes to Reviewer**:

```
This extension does not require account credentials to test. Core functionality:
1. Click extension icon → "Extract Text" to extract content from any webpage
2. Choose a voice source (System/Browser voices work without API keys)
3. Click "Read Aloud" to hear the content

Optional cloud voice integrations (ElevenLabs, Google Cloud, Resemble) require user's own API keys entered in Options.
```

7.  **Review**: Firefox performs automated review followed by manual check.

### Firefox for Android

The extension supports Firefox for Android (v142+) via `gecko_android: {}` in the manifest.

**Known Limitations:**
- **System voices**: SpeechSynthesis API support varies by Android device
- **Cloud voices**: Work via audio fallback (ElevenLabs, Google, Resemble)
- **UI**: Popup displays in mobile view; touch interactions supported

**Testing on Android:**
1. Install Firefox for Android (v142+)
2. Navigate to `about:debugging` on desktop Firefox
3. Use "Connect" to pair with Android device
4. Install extension via remote debugging, or wait for AMO approval

## 4. Microsoft Edge Add-ons

1.  **Account**: Register at the [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/microsoftedge/overview).
2.  **Create New**: Click "Create new extension".
3.  **Upload**: Upload `readalong-chrome.zip` (Edge supports Chrome extensions natively).
4.  **Metadata**: Provide Edge-specific descriptions and assets if desired.

## 5. Safari (Mac App Store)

Safari extensions are bundled within a native Mac app.
1.  **Apple Developer Program**: Requires an active membership.
2.  **Xcode**: Open the Xcode project generated by `xcrun safari-web-extension-converter`.
3.  **App Store Connect**: Create a new app record.
4.  **Archive & Upload**: In Xcode, select "Product" > "Archive", then "Distribute App" to upload to App Store Connect.

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the `manifest.json` version matches the store requirements (MV3 for most, Safari handles it via the converter).
